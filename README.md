Hover Effect
============

How a testimonial item act when hovered. Just apply the class to an unordered-list element which has structured element as follows:


    <ul class="the-class-you-choose">
      <li><img src="path/to/your/image/image.png"><a href="">An anchor element to write a short description.</a></li>
      <li><img src="path/to/your/image/image.png"><a href="">An anchor element to write a short description.</a></li>
      <li><img src="path/to/your/image/image.png"><a href="">An anchor element to write a short description.</a></li>
    </ul>

So elements that you should use are:
- Unordered-list `<ul>`
- Image `<img>`, and
- Anchor `<a>`

Don't forget to put `.testi` class first to build the testimonial element then put one of class bellow:
- Reveal with class `.testi-reveal`
- Flip with class `.testi-flip`
- Slide with class `.testi-slide`
